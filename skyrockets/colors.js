/*
	This file defines colours used on the skyrockets. Currently the skyrocket explosion shapes defined in
	explosions.js may use up to 3 colours so all colour definifions here must contain 3 colours, but note you can
	make 2 or all three of the colours the same if you want single colour explosions.

	Note: that color 1 is used for the colour of the body of the rocket.
